    <div class="about">
      <p>I am a developer/designer who enjoys creating interactive experiences in the browser either on mobile, desktop,
        laptop or tablets. I have an interest in frontend
        development with a small insight into running the backend with experience with creating & maintaining SQL
        databases. <br><br> I spent my time in education at Edinburgh college where I began to pique an
        interest in the user experience within web applications, from there I moved onto Napier University where I
        eventually graduated with a 2:1 classification in Web Design & Development. <br><br>
        This course allowed me to learn and experience working with users to plan, create & test my designs either that
        be prototyping or full-blown applications.

      <h2>Featured Project</h2>

      <h3>Little Boxes</h3>
      <p class="featured-descripton">Little Boxes is a VR puzzle game that has been developed to run in a browser via PC
        or mobile. Using the A-Frame framework I have managed to develop this experience for the use of a Google
        Cardboard. <br><br>
        This game was designed in progression with a study on how the users' experience can be improved within a VR
        environment. Looking at different UX methods I have managed to create an experience that a user can hopefully
        interact with without experiencing the usual symptoms of VR.
