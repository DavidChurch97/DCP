    <div class="about">
      <p>GameSearch was a project which I was assigned and worked on during one off my web technologies modules during
        my time in university. I was tasked to create a web application which had a frontend design created from
        wireframes. Once I had a design I went to develop the frontend design using Bootstrap as this was my main go to
        for frontend development due to its responsiveness. The applications'
        backend was built using python and JavaScript, the application was developed with Python Flask & the data
        information was handled in JSON files. <br><br>

        The idea behind this web app was for the user to be able to display a list of popular games covering all genres
        on three gaming platforms;
        PC, Xbox & PS4. From here they could sort each table and if interested sent to the best marketplace related to
        each game to view more details. <br> <br>
