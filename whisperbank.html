      <p>Whipser Bank was a design project that I had completed when I was given the task to gain an oppertunity at a
        job interview. I took the design they requested and due to not proceeding further
        I thought it would be a fun little project to work on taking the static design and develpoing it into a
        application that can be view on mobile devices. <br><br> Whipser Bank was a design project that I had completed
