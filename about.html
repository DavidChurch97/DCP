        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is David Church, I currently am based in West Lothian. My educational background includes attending Edinburgh College which I earned a diploma in Interactive Media allowing me to further my education and attend Napier University. <br><br> During my time at Napier I managed to complete my four-year degree earning a 2:1 Bsc Hons Degree in Web Design & Development. It was during my time in education where I found an interest in developing and designing web apps, I also have learned about the important side of UX in the creation of applications during my time at Napier. <br><br>
            In my free time I am an avid gamer who primarily plays on PC, my main games of interest at the moment of writing this are CS:GO & Call of Duty: Cold War (zombies mostly). I also have a large interest in media such as TV shows, films and music. <br><br> I picked up playing D&D during my time in university and have been actively playing with the same group of players for the past 3 years, this has helped with keeping my brain working in a creative way to come up with interesting ideas for my characters.
