    <div class="about">
      <p>Little Boxes is a VR puzzle game that has been developed to run in a browser via PC or mobile. Using the
        A-Frame framework
        I have managed to develop this experience for the use of a Google Cardboard. <br><br>

        This game was designed in progression with a study on how the users' experience can be improved within a VR
        environment. Looking at different UX methods I have
        managed to create an experience that a user can hopefully interact with without experiencing the usual symptoms
        of VR. <br><br> <strong>Built Using A-Frame</strong> <br> A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual
        reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not
        just a 3D scene graph or a mark-up language;
        the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable
        structure to three.js. <br><br>

        <br> I picked the A-Frame framework as I saw this as the best opportunity for myself to learn something new that
        I thought was interesting and allowed me to explore the topic of VR for the web. <br><br>
        <strong>Developed for the Google Cardboard</strong> <br> Little Boxes has been built for the use of a Google
        Cardboard. However, it is possible to enjoy this game through a computer as it uses the interactions of mouse
        controls. <br> <br> <strong>Overall Thoughts</strong> <br>
        Using the framework I learned about how to create/edit 3D objects within Blender, how to work with glTF models
        in a browser & I gained experience in using packaged items in which people created via JavaScript.
