    <div class="about">
      <p>BDOWiki is a Python Flask project I worked on during a module in university. I was tasked to create a web
        application on a topic I was interested in which had a large amount of information and present it in a way which
        was user-friendly and included multiple interactions for the user. This web application is a wiki about a game
        called 'Black Desert Online' which is a MMO that at the time of
        creation was only playable on the PC. I took this topic and managed to create a website which had information on
        everything about the game. <br><br>

        <img src="img/2-bdowiki/guide-info.png" id="lbox1" /> <br>

        I developed and designed the webpage by using Bootstrap for the frontend, Python Flask & jQuery for the backend
        along with a little of PHP for the contact form interaction. <br> <br>
